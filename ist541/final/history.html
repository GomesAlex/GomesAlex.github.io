	<h2>Fountain Pen History</h2>
	<p>Fountain pens evolved from dip pens, such as quill pens, which required the user to dip 
	the pen into a bottle after writing several words. This was a messy process and lacked 
	portability. The idea of having an ink reservoir in the pen is rumored to have begun 
	with Leonardo da Vinci, but it was not until the 1800's when the fountain pen became a 
	dependable writing instrument.</p>
	
	<p>The pen's design revolves around a metal nib that touches the paper, an ink feed that 
	resides behind the pen, and the body of the pen. What has changed and developed over 
	the years is the ink feed technology and filling mechanism. Lewis Edson Waterman and 
	Parker Pen Company contributed to improving feed technology by improving gravity and 
	capillary action so pens wouldn't accidentally dump ink while writing. Filling systems 
	started as ink in the barrel of the pen or a rubber sac and have evolved in many forms. 
	In modern times, the primary filling systems are cartridge/converter and piston filling, 
	allowing for a consistent, quick ink fill that reduces accidental ink dumps or what is 
	known as "burping."</p>

	<p>Fountain pens range from

	that use special techniques to craft works of art with exquisite materials that can be 
	worth tens of thousands of dollars. Here is a great example below, and it is the pride 
	of my collection. A Namiki Urushi Lacquer Vermilion No. 50:

	<p>While it appears to be a big plastic pen, it is made from urushiol, a sap from a 
	Japanese tree similar to poison oak. The toxic sap is treated and crafted into a 
	meticulously and labor-intensive lacquer applied one coat at a time and cured in a 
	special humid controlled cabinet for 24-48 hours. This process is repeated up to 60 
	times to create the incredibly beautiful and highly prized material.</p>
