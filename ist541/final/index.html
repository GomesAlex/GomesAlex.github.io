	<h2>Why Are Fountain Pens Still a Thing?</h2>
	<p>The fountain pen may conjure antique images of a writing instrument that is obsolete 
	in contemporary society. These types of pens aren't a necessity; however, the idea of 
	writing with a well-made, highly customizable pen that lays down ink of an infinite 
	number of colors is a truly unique experience. </p>

	<p>This site was created by brainstorming on a pad of paper sitting at the kitchen 
	table. I find the absence of technology aids in calming my mind and focusing on the 
	topic at hand. Additionally, fountain pens provide an eco-friendly option since you 
	can refill your pen without disposing of it as you would a standard ballpoint. As a 
	hobby, there are 
	<a href="https://www.sfpenshow.com/" target="_blank">fountain pen shows</a>
 	worldwide, <a href="https://www.hoosierpenclub.com/" target="_blank">social clubs</a>, and 
	<a href="https://www.fountainpennetwork.com/forum/" target="_blank">online communities</a> 
	to enjoy the form and function of pens and inks that go with them. Without further 
	ado, please enjoy perusing the pages of this site, and delve into the world of fountain 
	pens with me.</p>
